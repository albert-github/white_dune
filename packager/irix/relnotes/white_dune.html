<b>white_dune</b> is graphical X3DV/VRML97 editor and animation tool (in development)
<br><img src=Img/dunelogo.jpg>
<p>
 white_dune is:
 <ul>
  <li> a graphical editor to load/create/store X3D/VRML97 files
  <li> a simple NURBS/Superformula based 3D modeller
  <li> a 3D animation tool
  <li> a commandline X3D/VRML97 compiler in development
  <li> a program with (currently) 3 different GUIs
  <li> a program for beginners/children to create their first 3D animation ("-4kids")
  <li> a tool (and examples) that supports you in learning X3D or VRML97
  <li> a tool to load static/animated X3D/VRML97 files (directly or via "Inline"
       commands) created by programs like maya, 3D Studio MAX, Cinema4D, blender, 
       wings3d, art of illusion etc. and add interaction/scripting 
  <li> a tool to manipulate 3D data with 3D input devices (e.g. joystick/spaceball)
  <li> a tool to view 3D data with quadbuffer stereoview (e.g. shutterglases)
  <li> a open framework to create or process 3D data and store it as a ISO standard 
  <li> a open source project
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
X3D and VRML97 are the ISO standard for displaying 3D data over the web. 
This include animation, realtime interaction and multimedia (image, movie, 
sound). VRML97 can be written
by popular programs like maya, catia, 3D Studio MAX, cinema4D and others. 
Dune can read X3DV/VRML97 files, display and let the user change the 
scenegraph/fields.<br> Some documentation how to use dune is included.<br>
It is possible to create complicated (including not 
rounded IndexedFaceSet) shape objects with NURBS modelling in white_dune, 
but it can not compare with general purpose 3D mesh modellers with VRML97 
export.<br>
Examples for open source 3D modellers with mesh (IndexedFaceSet) VRML97 export
are wings3D, Art of Illusion or blender. Maybe a extra VRML97 exporter is 
needed for some versions of blender.<br>
<p>
Despite Dune/white_dune is not complete yet (especially in the 3D window),
it let you already use more X3D/VRML97 features then most other graphical 
X3D/VRML97 producing tools.
<p>
Under IRIX, white_dune has support for stereoscopic "toe in" view via 
"quadbuffer" capable stereo visuals. It has some support for
6DOF inputdevices like Spaceball or Magellan via the Xinput protocol.
It has also support for a Ascension Flock of Birds magnetic headtracker
(navigation only).
