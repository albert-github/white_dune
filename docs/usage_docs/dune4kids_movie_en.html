<h1>How to build a movie (easy)</h1>
<br>
This tutorial needs at least 
<a href="https://wdune.ourproject.org">white_dune</a> version 1.556.
<br> 
<h2>First a few informations to read</h2>
<br>
On some systems (e.g. Linux KDE/Gnome and SGI IRIX 4dwm), there is a 
program icon fuer "dune4kids", it looks something like this:<br>
<img src="dune4kids2.png">
<img src="dune4kids.png">
<img src="dune4kids3.png">
<img src="dune4kids4.png">
<br><br>
On systems like Micro$oft Windows or MacOSX there is only one (other)
programm icon:<br>
<img src="dune.png">
<img src="dune2.png">
<img src="dune4.png">
<img src="dune5.png">
<img src="dune3.png">
<!-- <img src="dune6.png"> -->
<img src="dune7.png">
<br><br>
Normally, the program of this icon starts with the english full version,
usually with very much icons and too much menues.
<br>
<a href="dune4kids_start_en.html" target="_blank">
  <img src="dune_start_en.png"><br><br>
</a>
In this case, you have to switch to dune4kids.<br> 
You have to <a href="dune4kids_start_en.html" target="_blank"> 
click here</a> to switch to the right version.<br>
<img src="frog01_en.png">
<br><br>
<h2>What to do, if the program crashes ?</h2>
With a bit of luck, you can load the last situation, if there is a
new ".dune_crash" file in the list of recent files.
<br>

<br>
<h1>Navigation</h1>
Navigation means the movment in the 3D modell.<br>
This is important, cause it can happen very easily, that you get inside or
behind your peace of work and see therefore nothing.<br><br>
When you see nothing there are two way to continue, ofthen you use this
ways together:
<ul>
<li> <b>Move backwards</b><br>
     You can go forwards and backwards, if you press together the 
     left mouse button and the "Shift" key on the keyboard and move the
     mouse up and down.
     If you use "Examine" (when the icon <img src="examine.png"> is pressed)
     this also works with the middle button of a 3-button mouse.
     If there is a mouse with a scroll wheel, you have to press the mouse
     wheel.
</li>
<li> <b>Turn the 3D world</b><br>
     When you press together the left mouse button and the "Control" key
     on the keyboard ("ctrl" on a english keyboard) you can turn the
     whole 3D-world around you. 
     This is usually used to look to a new created object near to you
     from all sides, but do not help, when you are into the void.<br>
     But keep in mind, that the content can be not only be hidden behind 
     you, it can be also above, below, left or right.<br>
     You need to turn around a lot to find your object.
</li>
</ul>
Additionally there you can press together the left mouse button, the "Shift" 
key and the "Control" key and move the mouse (or use the icon 
<img src="move_along_screen.png">). This results in the movement in direction
of the screen plane: up, down, left and right.
<br>
<br>
After you find the object and moved near to it, you should press again the
"Examine" icon <img src="examine.png"> in order to continue to work normally.
<br>
You should also select the object and press the icon
<img src="icon_turnpoint.png">, so you can turn the object as usual.
<br>
<h1>Icons for changes</h1>
In Order to show, how things are changed, a box is created.
<br>
<img src="new_box.png">
<br><br>
Icons, to changed whole objects:
<ul>
<li>Move: <img src="schieb.png"><br>
<img src="translate_icon.png">
</li>
<li>Rotate: <img src="rot.png"><br>
<img src="rotate_icon.png">
</li>
<li>Scale: <img src="scale.jpg"><br>
<img src="scale_icon.png">
</li>
<li>uniform scale: <img src="uniform_scale.png"><br>
<img src="uniform_scale_icon.png">
</li>
<li>move center of rotation: <img src="center.jpg"><br>
<img src="turnpoint_icon.png">
</li>
</ul>
With small white boxes you can change the objects itself.
With the single arrow icons <img src="xyz.png"> you can select the direction.
<br>
For example if only the green arrow is pushed,
<img src="y_only.jpg"> you can move the little box<br> 
<br>
<img src="yonly_1.jpg"> 
<br>
only into the direction of the green arrow.<br>
<br>
<img src="yonly_2.jpg">. 
<br>
In the same way as arrows grabed by the stem to move inside a plane,
you can also push two arrows <img src="xz_only.jpg"> in one time
to move a little box in one plane. 
<br>
<h1>How to build a movie (easy)</h1>
<br>
VRML/X3D let you create an animation, but do not support the creation
of a movie with two or more scenes.<br>
white_dune can help here, cause if supports the creation of a movie using
standard VRML/X3D scripting or X3DOM Scripting.<br>
If the file is exported to renderman RIB files, the created movie data
is also exported.  
You don't have to obey the following description exactly, but should 
(at least at the first reading) stick to the clue.<br>
The movie will show a moving sphere, a moving cone and two different 
Viewpoints (aka "camera").<br>
<h2>Moving Sphere</h2>
To create a sphere, use <em>New -&gt; Sphere</em>.<br>
<br>
<img src="movie1.png">
<br>
Select the Transform.
<br>
<img src="movie2.png">
<br>
Use <em>Animation -&gt; Create curve animation (need Transform)</em>
<br>
<img src="movie3.png">
<br>
Change 5 to 2 in the form amd press OK.
<br>
<img src="movie4.png">
<br>
A animation path has been created.<br>
Use <em>New -&gt; camera</em>
<br>
<img src="movie5.png">
<br>
Select the Transform and use <em>Change -&gt; Scenegraph &gt;
Move rest of branch into a new VrmlScene (end of VrmlCut)</em>
<br>
<img src="movie6.png">
<br>
A VrmlCut node has been created. If you click to it's + and all other +, 
you can see, that all nodes have been moved into the first VrmlScene.
<br>
<img src="movie7.png">
<br>
<h2>Moving Cone</h2>
To create a cone, use <em>New -&gt; Cone</em>.<br>
<br>
<img src="movie8.png">
<br>
Select the Transform of the cone.
<br>
<img src="movie9.png">
<br>
Use <em>Animation -&gt; Animate (need object e.g. Transform)</em>
<br>
<img src="movie10.png">
<br>
Change the 5 to 2 and press OK.
<br>
<img src="movie11.png">
<br>
Use <em>New -&gt; camera</em>
<br>
<img src="movie12.png">
<br>
Select the PositionInterpolator which has only the start-value.
<br>
<img src="movie13.png">
<br>
Select the Transform of the cone.
<br>
<img src="movie14.png">
<br>
In the lower bar, click the red circle and click the double triangles.
<br>
<img src="movie15.png">
<br>
Select the Transform of the cone.
<br>
<img src="movie16.png">
<br>
Move the cone by dragging the arrows.
<br>
<img src="movie17.png">
<br>
The new value has been recorded.<br>
Select the Transform and use <em>Change -&gt; Scenegraph &gt;
Move rest of branch into a new VrmlScene (end of VrmlCut)</em>
<br>
<img src="movie18.png">
<br>
Nothing is shown, but when you press the blue triangle in the lower bar,
the animation loops.<br>
<br>
<img src="movie19.png">
<br>
You can use e.g. <em>File -&gt; Export X3DOM html</em> to export the file
into a HTML file, that can be edited with your favorite XHTML editor.<br>
With aqsis and mencoder installed (e.g. under Ubuntu Linux) you can create the
following video<br> <video src="movie.mp4" controls>Video problem</video>
<pre>
rm -rf RibExport*.tif && run_dune_and_aqsis.sh file.x3dv
mencoder -o movie.mp4 "mf://untitled*.tif" -nosound -of lavf -lavfopts format=mp4 -ovc x264 -x264encopts pass=1:bitrate=2000:crf=24 -mf type=tif:fps=24
</pre>
