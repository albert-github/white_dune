 <title>XML parser information</title> 
</head> 
<p>
Thanks to Doug Sanden, it should load XML/X3D files (with the same limitations 
as the X3DV parser) but it is not intensely tested.<br>
You may prefer to use a XML/X3D -> X3DV translator, like aopt, which comes 
with the instant reality X3D browser.<br>
For more information see the script x3dxml2vrml.sh in the tools directory
of the source package.
