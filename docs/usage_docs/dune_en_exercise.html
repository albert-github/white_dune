<h2>dune for the impatient</h2> 
<p> 
In VRML97 the scenegraph, the Routes and Field Values is all you need 
to describe a VRML-World. Dune let you edit/create this. <br>
Therefore it is sufficient to show two screenshots to give you a hint
how dune works.
</p>
<h3>Animation</h3> 
<p>
<img src=dune_animation.png>
<br>
<br>
To build a Animation, you can also use the menuitem
<em> Actions -> animate </em>.
</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3> 
<p>
<img src=dune_interaktion.png>
<br>
</p>
You can find some typical VRML examples (you can load into dune and combine
with other VRML files) about animation, interaction and programming 
<a href=../typical_vrml_examples/index.html>here</a>.
