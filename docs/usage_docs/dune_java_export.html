<h2><a name="javaexport">White_dune export to java</a></h2>
<p>
White_dune supports the export of java source code from X3DV/VRML files 
since version 0.29 beta 1331.<br>
A simple example of the usage as a java source code exporter can be found 
<a href="../export_example_java/jme">at the directory of a example</a> for 
usage with the <a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/"> java monkey engine</a>.
<br>
<!--
Unfortunatly, some important java based 3D engines like java3d or the 
java monkey engine do not support the rendering of polygons with varying 
number of edges, like it is possible with OpenGL (or 
<a href="http://jogl.dev.java.net">jogl</a>).<br>
To use the triangle based 3D objects in the 3D engines, mesh based X3D nodes
(like IndexedFaceSet) needs to be converted either to the X3D nodes 
IndexedTriangleSet or TriangleSet.<br>
Of course it would be possible to account the mesh of X3D nodes like 
Extrusion or NurbsPatchSurface in java, but this may get complicated.<br>
Instead it may be wise, to convert this nodes in white_dune to 
IndexedTriangleSet or TriangleSet as well.<br>
