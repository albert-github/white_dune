# According to a short interview of Uwe Woessner, the meaning of the 
# fields/events are:
#
# The localKeyPressed/localKeyReleased can be used to read letters from
# the keyboard, if you have a keyboard and if you don't want to press the
# letter 'q' which quits cover 8-(
#
# The fields localPosition and localOrientation act like a ProximitySensor,
# but unlike a ProximitySensor it deliver the data of the tracking system,
# not the data of the virtual camera: turning the head in a CAVE do not 
# change the Proximitity data but change the localPosition/localOrientation
# data 
#   
# The fields position1 - position8 and orientation1 - orientation8 are 
# related to some covise plugins they are "not important"
#
# The meaning of the other fields are not known yet
