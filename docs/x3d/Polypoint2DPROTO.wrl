# META "description" "X3D Geometry2D component nodes, implemented as prototypes for backwards compatibility with VRML 97. Arc2D specifies a 2D linear circular arc. ArcClose2D specifies a portion of a circle. Circle2D specifies a 2D circular line. Disk2D specifies a 2D circular disk. Polyline2D specifies 2D line segments. Polypoint2D specifies 2D points. Rectangle2D specifies a 2D rectangle. TriangleSet2D specifies 2D triangles. 2D nodes are considered particularly helpful for building user interfaces such as Heads-Up Displays (HUDs)."
