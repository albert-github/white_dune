To use this example on Linux/UNIX/MacOSX, create a VRML/X3D file, save it
as "Untitled.wrl" into this directory and type

$ make

The resulting executable is named "./render"

To use this example on other systems, create a VRML/X3D file, export
it with white_dune as a C(mesh) file named CExport.c, compile and link it 
together with ../libCRWD.h, main.c, the glut library and all needed opengl
libraries
