 <title>Using ISO/IEC14772-1:1997/Amd. 1:2002(E) NurbsSurface with cosmoplayer</title>

<h2><a name="nurbs">What are Nurbs ?</a></h2>
<p> 
  NURBS means "Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines". 
  In short, NURBS can be used to build rounded faces by transfering 
  only very few data. A mathematical formula is used to construct the faces.
</p>
<h2><a name="browser">My browser do not understand "NurbsSurface"</a></h2>
<p> 
NurbsSurface (and other Nurbs objects) are part of the  
<a href=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/vrml97am1/fdam/index.html>
ISO/IEC14772-1:1997/Amd. 1:2002(E) VRML standard</a>. Some VRML97 browsers like 
cc3d or cortona already have the NurbsSurface Node available, while most 
other browsers
do not support it yet.<br><br>
White_dune support the VRML Amendment 1 NurbsSurface, but this would be useless 
for other browsers.<br><br>
For the Cosmo Player browser (at least the version 2.1.5 on IRIX and 
and the version 2.1.1 on M$Windows), it is possible to use 
a <a href=NurbsSurfacePROTO.wrl>NurbsSurface PROTO</a> written in 
javascript to make use of the NurbsSurface node (texCoord not supported yet).
<br><br>
To view NurbsSurface nodes with the Cosmo Player browser 
you need to include this <a href=NurbsSurface.wrl>EXTERNPROTO declaration 
</a>in your VRML file (e.g. by using File -> import in white_dune).<br>
Other Browsers with NurbsSurface support will fall back to their 
own (very much faster) implementation.
<br><br>
<a href=NurbsSurface_example.wrl>Click here</a> (and be patient till 
the accounting is ready) if you have the Cosmo Player browser 
(at least the version 2.1.5 on IRIX or version 2.1.1 on M$Windows work)
to see a example of the usage of the NurbsSurface EXTERNPROTO.
